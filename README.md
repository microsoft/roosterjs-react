# Demo only

This repository is a demo projection for the HTML editor [roosterjs](https://github.com/microsoft/roosterjs).
It shows how to build user interface on top of roosterjs based on React.

The repository is not actively maintained. To build your UI with rooserjs, we recommend building with your own code
rather than directly importing code from this repository.

Thanks for using roosterjs.

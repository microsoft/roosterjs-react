# Demo only

This repository is a demo projection for the HTML editor [roosterjs](https://github.com/microsoft/roosterjs).
It shows how to build user interface on top of roosterjs based on React.

The repository is not actively maintained. For a newer version of roosterjs-react, please refer to [roosterjs-react](https://github.com/microsoft/roosterjs/tree/master/packages-ui)
pacakge in [roosterjs](https://github.com/microsoft/roosterjs) repository. We now provide a new react component "Rooster" as a react wrapper of roosterjs.
You can also build your own UI with roosterjs on top of any other UI framework.

Thanks for using roosterjs.
